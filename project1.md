Project 1

Describe what is a package? Also, describe what is a library? What are the two steps you need to execute in order to install a package and then make that library of functions accessible to your workspace and current python work session?

A programming package is a bundle of functions that can be utilized in a certain programming language. Different packages may have bundles of functions that are useful for different purposes. These packages must be installed on your computer to access them. 

In contrast, a library is simply a set of similar functions that are paired togehter and can be used in your program. Libraries are often a collection of packages whose functions serve similar purposes.

The two steps which must be taken in order to access a packages functions are downloading and importing to the workspace. In order to download packages in the software we will be using (PyCharm), first go to preferences. Next, under the project dropdown on the python interpreter page there will be a list of the accessible programming packages. In the bottom left of the page, there is a plus sign that once clicked on, will allow you to search for and download a large number of packages. Finally, once the package is downloaded and visible on the python interpretor page, you may access it in any workspace in the future by typing the import function and then the name of the package. This will grant access to all functions present in the imported package.
